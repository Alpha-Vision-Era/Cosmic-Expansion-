## Overview

**Cosmic Expansion** presents a symbolic yet scientifically inspired visualization of galactic motion — where Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, is reinterpreted as a gravitational rupture point.

The model draws its metaphor from a punctured bag of water, symbolizing how matter flows out in structured motion post-rupture — much like galactic expansion post-Big Bang. This analogy offers a bridge between fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and metaphysical cosmology.

## Core Concept

- **Sagittarius A*** as the "rupture point"
- Expansion modeled as **gravitational flow** through puncture
- Inspired by **fluidic dispersal** and symbolic visualization
- Designed to provoke philosophical, scientific, and intuitive thought
