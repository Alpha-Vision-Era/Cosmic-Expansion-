## About Syed Waleed Mehboob Ali

**Divine Frequency Alignment Practitioner | Brainwave-Based Healer | In Training with HeartMath methods and the science of Heart-Brain Coherence**

Syed Waleed Mehboob Ali is a frequency-based healer from Pakistan who combines brainwave alignment, mental coherence, and energy balancing techniques in his practice. He is currently training in the science of Heart-Brain Coherence, inspired by the research of the HeartMath Institute.

Although not yet officially certified, he integrates HeartMath-informed concepts such as heart-focused breathing, emotional self-regulation, and coherence practices into his unique healing method, which he calls *Divine Frequency Alignment*.

His approach is non-hypnotic, non-ritualistic, and free from traditional spiritual symbolism. Instead, it emphasizes clarity of thought, mental focus, and natural energetic resonance to help clients with emotional blocks, stress, relationship imbalances, and unexplainable delays in career or life progress.

Waleed believes true healing occurs when the brain, heart, and subtle energies of the body come into resonance — a concept supported by scientific studies in neurocardiology and quantum biology.

> “I am not a guru or mystic. I am simply a practitioner of mental coherence and divine alignment. All healing belongs to Allah.” – Syed Waleed Mehboob Ali

## Limitation and Scope 

Cosmic Expansion is an independent research initiative exploring the symbolic and philosophical layers of cosmic motion through intuitive analogies.
    Inspired by the Punctured Bag Analogy, this project bridges scientific observation with metaphysical understanding, offering a unique lens on the genesis of galactic structures.
    All interpretations aim to enrich, not replace, existing scientific frameworks.
